Oi!

I'm Danilo. New to programming, just made May's piscine for Grit:Lab in Åland Islands. I'm sharing my code from there with you. If you're making the 01-Edu piscine somewhere else and need help – after asking your colleagues – you can contact me!

In my website you can check more about me: www.danilocangucu.com
